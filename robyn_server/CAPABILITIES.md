# Robyn Runtime Capabilities Map (LangGraph API Parity)

This document tracks the Robyn runtime server's **endpoint parity** with the `langgraph dev` (LangGraph API) surface area.

**Current Status (Updated 2024-02-05):**
- ✅ **Tier 1 Complete** — Core CRUD + SSE Streaming
- ✅ **Tier 2 Complete** — Search/Count/List + Join Streams
- 🟡 **Tier 3 Partial** — Store + Metrics implemented; Crons/A2A/MCP deferred

**Testing:**
- 240+ unit tests passing
- Full integration tests with vLLM backend validated
- 37 API routes registered and functional

> Source of truth for the desired contract: `langgraph dev` OpenAPI (`/openapi.json`).
> A reference copy is checked in at: `.agent/tmp/langgraph-serve_openape_spec.json`.

## Status Legend

- ✅ **Implemented**: Works end-to-end and matches expected request/response types
- 🟡 **Partial**: Some functionality implemented, some features deferred
- ⚪ **Not Started**: Not yet present

## Parity Tiers

### Tier 1 — Must Have (OAP + E2E + Streaming)
Goal: Create assistant → create thread → run → **stream** → read final state.

Includes:
- Auth (Supabase JWT)
- Assistants CRUD minimum
- Threads CRUD minimum
- Runs (stateful) + status polling
- SSE streaming (stateful + stateless)
- Thread state/history output

### Tier 2 — Developer UX / Client Convenience
Goal: Make Studio/SDK-style workflows comfortable.

Includes:
- search/count/list endpoints
- join streams (thread and run)
- wait/join convenience endpoints

### Tier 3 — Platform Features
Goal: parity with broader LangGraph API surface.

Includes:
- Store API
- Crons
- A2A
- MCP server endpoints
- metrics/info parity

## Global Behaviors (Parity Requirements)

### Authentication (Required)
- All non-system endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
- JWT verification uses Supabase (`SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_KEY`) as in `tools_agent/security/auth.py`.
- Ownership is enforced via metadata:
  - On create: merge `metadata.owner = <user_id>`
  - On read/search/list: filter to `metadata.owner == <user_id>`

### Error Shape
- Prefer LangGraph API error response shape:
  - `{"detail": "<human readable message>"}`

### Metadata / Session Context
- `user_id` comes from Supabase-verified JWT user.
- `session_id` is treated as pass-through metadata (do not invent semantics yet).
- Do not log tokens or secrets.

### Streaming (SSE) — Captured Specification

**Response Headers (required):**
```
Content-Type: text/event-stream; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: no-store
x-accel-buffering: no
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Location: /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/stream  (stateful)
          /runs/{run_id}/stream  (stateless)
Content-Location: /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}  (stateful)
                  /runs/{run_id}  (stateless)
```

**SSE Frame Format:**
```
event: <event_type>
data: <json_payload>

```
Note: Each frame ends with a blank line (two newlines after `data:`).

**Event Types (in order of emission):**
1. `metadata` — First event: `{"run_id": "...", "attempt": 1}`
2. `values` — Initial state with input messages
3. `messages/metadata` — Rich LLM invocation metadata (auth, config, etc.)
4. `messages/partial` — Streaming token chunks (multiple events)
5. `updates` — Graph node updates: `{"agent": {"messages": [...]}}`
6. `values` — Final state with all messages
